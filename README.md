examples of code from my Data structures class
The code covers two projects, the first involved creating the trieNode and trie classes to develop a trie structure 
the intent of this was to build a trie tree that stored word alphabetically and could be accessed easily through recursion
this files are in the source files
the second part was creating a "text twist" game wherein the user input 7 letters and the texttwist class will recursively find
all the solutions to the possible combinations of these letters (words length 3 or long and conferring with the 
Official Scrabble Player's dictionary which was hard coded to be loaded)
